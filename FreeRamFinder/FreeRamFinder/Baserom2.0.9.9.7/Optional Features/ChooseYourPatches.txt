A lot of baserom functions won't work without the patches, obviously.
But with FluxBase2ButNoPatches.bps, you can exempt specific patches from being applied.
Once you've patched FluxBase2ButNoPatches.bps and named it FluxBase2.smc, 
you can go to /Info, Settings, and Assets/Patches/.
 
If you want to exempt a patch from being applied, 
just open !ApplyAllPatches.bat in a text editor and remove the patches/lines you want.
Then double-click !ApplyAllPatches.bat to apply them.

(Note that if you do this, though, you also have to temporarily move the rom into the Patches folder. 
Put it back in the normal/main folder afterwards.)
