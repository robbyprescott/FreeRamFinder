;  Cluster Sprite Bowser Statue  ;
;         by JamesD28            ;
; ------------------------------ ;

; A variant of the Bowser Statue, that will shoot cluster sprites as it's flame projectiles instead of normal sprites. Additionally, you can customize the jumping
; speed/height of the statue, the X speed of the projectiles, and how often it shoots.

; Extra byte 1: Behaviours. Format: TTDDHPPP
	; T: Statue type.
		; 0 = Stationary.
		; 1 ($40) = Shoot fire.
		; 2 ($80) = Jumping.
		; 3 ($C0) = Jumping, shoot fire.
	; D: Initial direction and jumping behaviour.
		; 0 = Face/jump right.
		; 1 ($10) = Face/jump left.
		; 2 ($20) = Face/jump towards player.
		; 3 ($30) = Face/jump away from player.
	; H: If set ($08), the statue will hurt and can only be spinjumped off. If clear, it can be stood on.
	; P: Palette.

; Extra byte 2: Jump height/speed. Format: YYYYXXXX
	; Y: Y speed of the jump (how high the statue goes). Ranges from -$08 to -$78 in $10 increments.
	; X: X speed of the jump (how far the statue goes). Ranges from $08 to $78 in $08 increments. (inverted depending on direction).

; Extra byte 3: Projectile X speed.
; Extra byte 4: How often the statue shoots a projectile.

; ------------------------------

!JumpTimer = $30		; Time between each jump for the jumping types. This could have been an extra byte but I didn't feel like going over 4.

!FireNum = $06			; Cluster sprite number the fire projectile was inserted at.

!FireRand = 0			; 0 = Fire statues will always shoot at their regular specified interval.
						; 1 = The time before the first shot will be randomized, then shot at consistent intervals.
						; 2 = Each shot has a randomized time between them (centered around the specified shot interval in the range 0.5x-1.5x).

!FireSFX = $17			; SFX for shooting fire.
!FireSFXBank = $1DFC	; SFX bank.

!StatueHeadTile = $30		; Tile number for the statue's head.
!StatueBodyNormTile = $41	; Tile number for the statue's body when stationary.
!StatueBodyJumpTile = $35	; Tile number for the statue's body when jumping.
!StatueFeetTile = $56		; Tile number for the statue's feet. Used when jumping.
