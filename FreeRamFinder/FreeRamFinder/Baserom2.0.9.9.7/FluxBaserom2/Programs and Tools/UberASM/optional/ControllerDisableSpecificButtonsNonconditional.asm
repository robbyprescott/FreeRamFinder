; uberASM to disable controller buttons by janklorde   	;
; Special thanks to RussianMan							;

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; This is a simple uberASM that allows you to disable  	;
; any combination of controller inputs. You cannot     	;
; disable combinations of buttons without disabling    	;
; them individually. For example, if you wanted Y and B	;
; to function individually but Y+B to be disabled, this	; 
; is not possible. Please use sensibly, disabling all  	;
; buttons isn't going to be fun for anyone.				;

; Below, enter the buttons you want disbaled. 1 = disabled, 0 = enabled
; Format =  byetUDLR
; b = B; y = Y or X ; e = select; t = Start; U = up; D = down; L = left, R = right.
; Example: %00001011 would disable up, left and right respectively.
; setting bit 6 here (y) disables running completely.

!InputByte1 = #%00000000

; Below, enter the buttons you want disbaled. 1 = disabled, 0 = enabled
; Format = axlr----
; a = A; x = X only; l = L; r = R, - = null/unused.
; In this case the 4 least significant bits don't do anything and should be 0.
; Example: %10110000 would disable A, L and R respectively.
; setting bit 6 here (x) still allows you to still run, and sort of carry some stuff.
; I know. SMW is weird. 
; Disabling bit 6 in both input bytes completely disables carrying and running.


!InputByte2 = #%00000000
