; Press "R" on the Overworld to Switch Between Mario and Luigi
; By Bensalot 
;
;
; Set this code to Gamemode 0E in Uberasm
;
;*IMPORTANT* make sure to patch the lives.asm patch included or Luigi will have odd behavior when getting a game over.
;
; This will switch the player from Mario to and Luigi and back when Pressing the R button on the overworld during a Single Player
; game while leaving the 2 Player option in tact.
; It will take Mario's Score, Bonus Stars, Powerups, Yoshi's, and completely allows you to swap players without any odd behaviors
; like some of the other versions of "Switch Characters" codes.
; 
;*This will work with Smallhacker's Separate Player graphics patch to give Luigi separate graphics from Mario.
;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
;*This next note will be obsolete pending approval of my update to smallhackers sep Luigi gfx patch. If you download version 3 of the patch, 
; don't worry about this next part.
;
;To fix an issue with Smallhacker's Separate Luigi gfx patch V2 or below (as in if you download Version 3, don't worry about this), 
;add this line after org $00A1DA autoclean JML Select (uncomment of course) in the separate Luigi GFX patch version 1 or 2. Don't add this if you download V3
;
;
; org $00A0B9
; autoclean JML Select3
;
; Then add this line between between the Title and Change sections (again, uncomment first)
;    Select3:
;	 JSR Change
;	 JSR Upload
;    GoBack:
;    LDX.W $0DB3|!addr     ;(smallhackers code doesn't implement the SA1 feature so you'll have to convert the rest on your own. 
;                          ;If you don't use SA1, just remove "|!addr" from this code.
;                          ;Again, I submitted an update to that patch so if you download V3 none of this will even matter.)
;	 JML $00A0BF
;
;****** This uberasm will work without these changes******  I only added this if you are using version 2 of smallhackers separate luigi gfx but I also 
;submitted a change to the patch on smwcentral that will make this note obsolete pending approval. 
;These lines simply fix an issue that patch has where the player graphics won't update on the overworld map when starting as Luigi 
;or continueing from a Game Over. And of course it will make the graphics update on the overworld when using this uberasm. However, if you don't want to 
; bother with this because it entertains you to see green Mario or Red Luigi for a split second or 2 on the overworld map, by all means, don't add this stuff.
