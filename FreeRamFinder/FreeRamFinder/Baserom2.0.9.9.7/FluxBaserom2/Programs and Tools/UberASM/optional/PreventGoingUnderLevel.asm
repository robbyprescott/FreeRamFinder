; Temporary replacement for janky constrain Uber/patch

;Bottomless Pit Code by Blind Devil (based off of old patch by Ramp202)
;Also previously known as 'Floor Generator', this makes it so the player cannot
;move horizontally when offscreen from below, which is useful for people wanting
;to prevent people from skipping parts of a level from below. You can also set it
;to hurt or kill the player.

;Configurable defines:
;HURT/KILL EFFECT
;This determines what should happen to the player when they go offscreen from
;below.
;Possible values: 0 = nothing happens, 1 = hurt player, 2 = kill player.
!PitEffect = 0
