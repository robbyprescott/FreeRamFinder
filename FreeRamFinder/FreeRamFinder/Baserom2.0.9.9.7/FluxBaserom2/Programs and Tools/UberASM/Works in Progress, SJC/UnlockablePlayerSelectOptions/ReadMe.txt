WIP / proof of concept by SJC, etc.
(Need to find better FreeRAM that won't display the unlockable option for a second at load)

You can use this to disable being able to move the cursor up or down to select Two Player until a trigger is set, or in conjunction with the selectable Retry / No Retry patch.
Or if you use both codes together, you can also make the other option not even appear at all until the trigger is set.

Note that in its current state, this will overwrite your layer 3 for a number of scanlines, even on the edges.
