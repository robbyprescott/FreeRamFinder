;How X speed affects your jump. This table contains a list of values to be used on how high mario
;jumps. Valid values are #$80~#$FF. The lower the value, the higher mario jumps.
;
;Table format:
;	db $xx,$yy
;
;$xx is the normal jump speed.
;$yy is the spin jump speed.
;
;As you go down the list, that value is used for faster speeds (so the faster you run, the lower down the
;list it'll uses). Here's the formula:

;	LDA $7B		;\X speed absolute value (if negative, flip to positive to find distance from zero)
;	BPL +		;|
;	EOR #$FF	;|
;	INC A		;|
;	+		;/
;	LSR #2		;>Divide by 4 (76543210 turns into --765432)
;	AND #$FE	;>Clear bit 1 (--76543-)
;	TAX		;>Transfer to X
;	LDA $140D	;\If spinjumping, INX to make bit 0 set to use spin jump values
;	BEQ +		;|
;	INX		;/
;	+
;	LDA $00D2BD,x	;>This table location will not be used if you patch this.
;	STA $7D		;>And set Y speed.
;The maximum index is #$20 (if you going a speed of #$80).
