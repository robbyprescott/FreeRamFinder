Untraceable Variations Stem From These Addresses:
** These are just a warning ... a list of some files to keep your eye on.
** Might need to manually verify that the following variations of ram addresses
** aren't close in value to ones used in other cases in separate files listed.
** If address comes close to other addresses listed, consider changing the root
** freeram address to another available address in the smw central freeram table.
